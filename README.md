My name is Cameron Deao and I am a 26 year old computer programming student. I have resided within Texas for over 4 years and have been working as a bartender to put myself through school. I started programming when I was 19 at my local community college in California, and in the time since I started programming I've worked to achieve a career goal of working within game development. While I do have experience under my belt with writing code, I recognize that there is still much to learn so I can strengthen my skills and become a strong programmer for my future career.
